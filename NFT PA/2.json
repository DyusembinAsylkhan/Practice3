Pixel art is characterized by its distinct aesthetic, where each pixel serves as a visual element, and the entire image is constructed pixel by pixel. This style is often associated with retro video games, as early game consoles and computers had limited graphical capabilities, making pixel art an efficient and visually appealing choice for game graphics.",
